# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Loan Calculator project. Designed UI using Bootstrap and some CSS, also wrote few lines of JS.

**Thoughts:** It was quite a learning hour as I learned using bootstrap alongwith with my own CSS styling, still got more to learn about Bootstrap and CSS.
